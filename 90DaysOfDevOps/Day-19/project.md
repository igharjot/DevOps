# Day 19 – Shell Scripting Project: Log Rotation, Backup & Crontab

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Log Rotation Script
Create `log_rotate.sh` that:
1. Takes a log directory as an argument (e.g., `/var/log/myapp`)
2. Compresses `.log` files older than 7 days using `gzip`
3. Deletes `.gz` files older than 30 days
4. Prints how many files were compressed and deleted
5. Exits with an error if the directory doesn't exist

---

### Task 2: Server Backup Script
Create `backup.sh` that:
1. Takes a source directory and backup destination as arguments
2. Creates a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive (e.g., `backup-2026-02-08.tar.gz`)
3. Verifies the archive was created successfully
4. Prints archive name and size
5. Deletes backups older than 14 days from the destination
6. Handles errors — exit if source doesn't exist
