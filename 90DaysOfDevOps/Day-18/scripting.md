# Day 18 – Shell Scripting: Functions & Slightly Advanced Concepts

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Functions
1. Create `functions.sh` with:
   - A function `greet` that takes a name as argument and prints `Hello, <name>!`
   - A function `add` that takes two numbers and prints their sum
   - Call both functions from the script

### Task 2: Functions with Return Values
1. Create `disk_check.sh` with:
   - A function `check_disk` that checks disk usage of `/` using `df -h`
   - A function `check_memory` that checks free memory using `free -h`
   - A main section that calls both and prints the results

### Task 3: Strict Mode — `set -euo pipefail`
1. Create `strict_demo.sh` with `set -euo pipefail` at the top
2. Try using an **undefined variable** — what happens with `set -u`?
3. Try a command that **fails** — what happens with `set -e`?
4. Try a **piped command** where one part fails — what happens with `set -o pipefail`?

**Document:** What does each flag do?
- `set -e` →
- `set -u` →
- `set -o pipefail` →
